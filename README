Build Instructions
------------------

There are two required dependencies:

* libsndfile
  http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/
  
* Cairo
  http://www.cairographics.org/

These must be present and installed before this program can be built. An
autoconf-based "configure script" is used to configure the locations of
libraries and the optional dependencies. The usual options are accepted; the
most relevant here being:

  --with-sndfile-includes=DIRS
                          libsndfile include files are in DIRS
  --with-sndfile-libs=DIRS
                          libsndfile library files are in DIRS
  --with-cairo-includes=DIRS
                          Cairo include files are in DIRS
  --with-cairo-libs=DIRS  Cairo library files are in DIRS

A typical configure line (Bourne shell syntax) might be:

CFLAGS=-O3 LDFLAGS=-s ./configure --prefix=/usr --with-cairo-includes=/usr/include/cairo

Then a simple "make" will compile the program. "make install" will install
to the specified prefix.


Usage
-----

audiograph <input.wav> <output.png> <width> <height> <rrggbb>

 * <input.wav> may be any audio file supported by libsndfile, e.g. 
   WAV, FLAC or Ogg Vorbis
 * <width> and <height> should be integers
 * <rrggbb> should be a HTML-style RGB colour triplet, i.e. three
   hexadecimal values


Overview
--------

This utility plots a graphical representation of the audio waveform
contained in a given file, as a transparent PNG image with the
specified width, height and foreground colour. If the input file
contains stereo or multi-channel audio, it is downmixed to mono so
that only one waveform is plotted. On systems that do not support PNG
transparency, the background colour should appear as white.

The waveform is scaled to fit within the specified output dimensions.
Technically, it is plotted as a series of 1-pixel wide vertical lines
with length determined by the biggest and smallest sample values
encountered within the linearly scaled time period corresponding to
the width of 1 pixel. A logarithmic scale is used for the y-axis (i.e.
signal amplitude).

The input file may be in any file format supported by the libsndfile
library. WAV, FLAC and Ogg Vorbis are the most prominent of these but
there are many others; see the libsndfile documentation for more
details. A single dash "-" may be specified for the filename; in this 
case the audio will be read from standard input, although it must
still consist of a self-contained file supported by libsndfile.
